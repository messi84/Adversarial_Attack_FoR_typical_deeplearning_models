# A Implementation of Transferable Adversarial Attacks for Image and Video Object Detection

## 1. Introduction
- This code is the implementation of the paper [Transferable Adversarial Attacks for Image and Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12641)
- This paper has been received by IJCAI-19.


## 2. Demo
Just run this ipynb in colab.
 ```
 test.ipynb
 ```

## 3. Train
Just run this ipynb in colab.
 ```
 feature_and_attack_train.ipynb
 ```
## 4. Results
Training this network cost a lot of time, evary iteration cost around 7s(running in colab), while once training is comleted, the speed of generating adversarial examples is quite fast.
Due to the slow upload speed, we only show 7 examples in 'sdd' folder.
